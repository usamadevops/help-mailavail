# What do the numbers next to each email address on my list mean?

# Email Quality Scores and Deliverability Categories

During the email verification process, each verified email is assigned an email quality score, indicating its deliverability on a scale from 0 to 100. These scores correspond to distinct deliverability categories:

- **< 50**: **Undeliverable**
- **>= 50 and < 80**: **Risky**
- **>= 80**: **Deliverable**
- **0**: **Unknown**

These categories facilitate a quick assessment of the quality and deliverability of each email address, streamlining the management of your email lists.
