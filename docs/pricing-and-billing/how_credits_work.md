# How do credits work?

# Email Verification Credits

Each credit is equivalent to one email verification. It's important to note that unknown or duplicate email addresses are not counted against your credit amount.

The good news is that these credits never expire, and they come with built-in tiered discounts, providing you with added value and flexibility in your email verification process.
