# Email Verification Process

Our email verification process is designed to systematically validate the authenticity and deliverability of email addresses, ensuring the accuracy of your email list. When you initiate the verification process through our platform, the system performs a series of comprehensive checks. These include:

- Verifying the email syntax
- Ensuring the validity of the domain
- Confirming the existence of each email account

The results categorize emails into the following states:

- **Deliverable**
- **Undeliverable**
- **Risky**
- **Unknown**
- **Duplicate**

This provides valuable insights into the quality and reliability of each email address.

Integrating our robust verification process into your workflow helps maintain a high deliverability rate, enhancing the effectiveness of your communication efforts.
