# How do i save more lists in a single directory?

Certainly! You have the capability to add more than one list to a single directory in Mailavail. Simply open two or more modals of verified lists, one at a time. 

Click on the '**Add to Directory**' button, and a menu will display the available directory names. You can then choose the desired directory and proceed to add your lists to it. This user-friendly feature streamlines the process of grouping multiple email lists into a specific directory, providing you with an efficient way to organize and manage your data within Mailavail.
