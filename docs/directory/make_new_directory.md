# How do i make a new directory?

Certainly! To create a new directory, navigate to the **Directory** section. There, you'll find an option to "**Create New Directory**." 

Clicking on this option will open a modal prompting you to name your new directory. Once you've named the directory, it is created by clicking the '**Create**' button.
