# Can we remove directory if there any list exist?

Certainly! A directory cannot be removed if it contains a verified email list because the existence of a directory is tied to the presence of lists within it. In other words, when all the lists within a directory are deleted, the directory itself will be automatically removed.

This ensures that the removal process is cohesive and that directories are only eliminated when they no longer contain any associated email lists.
